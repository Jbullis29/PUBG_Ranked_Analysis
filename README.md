# PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS Analysis

## Do You Know What it Takes to Win?
The 2021 PUBG Mobile Global Championship has a $6,000,000 prize pool. But that's not all the PUBG related money up for grabs. There are also numerous esports betting sites where anyone (including you) can place a wager on most aspects of the game, by staking either real money or in-game items.

This repository was built to analyze and visualize data from PUBG matches with the end goal of using machine learning to predict outcomes and identify the most important features. 

In this project, we utilized Jupyter Notebook and Python to make an API call from PUBG's developer API.  This data was cleaned using Pandas in Jupyter notebook then used with Scikit-Learn to evaluate different Machine Learning models. 

We preprocessed the data in scikit-learn by splitting it into training and test data then scaling where necessary. 

HTML, Javascript, CSS and Bootstrap were used to display the visualiztions built with Tableau and Matplotlib.
