# PUBG_Ranked_Analysis
### Visualizing Air Quality in Colorado 

## About
This repository was built to analyze and visualize data from PUBG matches with the end goal of using machine learning to predict outcomes and identify the most important features. 

In this project, we utilized Jupyter Notebook and Python to make an API call from PUBG's developer API.  This data was cleaned using Pandas in Jupyter notebook then used with Scikit-Learn to evaluate different Machine Learning models. 

We preprocessed the data in scikit-learn by splitting it into training and test data then scaling where necessary. 

HTML, Javascript, CSS and Bootstrap were used to display the visualiztions built with Tableau and Matplotlib.
